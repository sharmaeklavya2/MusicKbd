# Musical Keyboard

Use your computer's keyboard like a piano.

This python 3 script uses ALSA's `speaker-test` to produce sound.
`speaker-test` comes pre-installed in Ubuntu 16.04.

Run `./music_kbd.py --help` to see how to use this program.

You can also pipe text into `./music_kbd.py`. The `-q` switch is helpful for that use case.
